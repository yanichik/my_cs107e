## Larson Scanner + Dimmer

### Central LED is brightest with dimmed side LEDs. Created WITHOUT using Pulse Width Modulation. Instead, simulate Duty Cycle using the variable on/off times of the LEDs, such that the on/off ratio is greater for the brigher LED, and lower for the dimmed LEDs. Duty Cycle determined by FULL & DIM1 variables, while transition time from LED to LED adjusted by size of DELAY variable
