## larson scanner with central bright LED and dimmed side LEDs. created WITHOUT using Pulse Width Modulation. Instead, simulate Duty Cycle using the variable on/off times of the LEDs, such that the on/off ratio is greater for the brigher LED, and lower for the dimmed LEDs. Duty Cycle determined by FULL & DIM1 variables, while ransition time from LED to LED adjusted by size of DELAY variable
